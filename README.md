# Spotify-clone
This project is a personal showcase of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills through the creation of a Spotify website clone. The goal is to replicate the visual and interactive aspects of the official Spotify website, showcasing a keen eye for design, responsive layout, and dynamic user experiences.
